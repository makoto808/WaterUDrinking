        The hydration insights in this app are informed in part by publicly available data from the **U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM)**, a division of the National Institutes of Health. In particular, hydration efficiency estimates are influenced by the concept of the **Beverage Hydration Index (BHI)**, which compares how different beverages affect fluid retention in the body. The hydration rates should be considered as approximations rather than precise values.
